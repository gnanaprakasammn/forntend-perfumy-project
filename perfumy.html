    <p>The growing use of perfume in India can be accredited to the rising working population, growing consumer preference to spend on grooming, increasing demand from millennial population, introduction of innovative fragrances by perfume manufacturers, and emergence of e-commerce channels facilitating online sales and easy availability of perfume for consumers.
 Rising brand awareness and availability of affordable price perfumes are also supporting the market growth.Although the Indian perfume market is being dominated by unorganized players, there are many opportunities seen by domestic marketers to bring in quality and organized brand name in the space. Domestic players like Fogg recently launched a range of perfumes in prices less than INR 500, which has left major brands reconsider their pricing strategy for selling perfumes in India. The Made in India perfumes now traverse from mass brands available at chemists and general stores to niche fragrances available online. Thanks to social media and expansive availability of the Internet, consumers are not shying away to experiment with local homegrown brands.

   <p>Currently, the Indian perfume industry is valued at USD500 billion, a small slice of the global industry, reported to worth around USD24 billion. However, the industry has a potential to develop into one of the biggest in the years to come as the new breed of Indian perfumers are breaking stereotypes and trying to raise the bar for the Indian perfumes. Perception and scale are two of the biggest challenges that Indian perfumery is facing. Developing strong persuasion skill to convince retails to stand up to market leaders and share shelf space could help consumers be aware of the Indian-made perfumes, which could further add to their sales.A perfume is a liquid mixture used to emit a pleasant odour.
